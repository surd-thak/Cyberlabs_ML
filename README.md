# Cyberlabs Machine Learning division
# ML Bootcamp
  
  
## Description
     The project aims for building some of the important Machine Learning libraries from scratch in python.
     The existing libraries used were pandas, numpy and matplotlib. 
     The Notebook used was Google Colab.
     The Datasets are in csv format.
      
## Features expected to be introduced/updated in near future
   - Some part of my code is hard-coded which shouldn't have been a case aiming for a library, hence I would want to make changes so that code can be used on any data.
   - Finding accuracy by using the algorithm on different parameter initialisation and different types of scaling and trying to understand reasons for the deviations.
   - Neutral network which as of now is 2 layered, would be much better if it has n layers which will be decided according to the wish of the user.
   - Adding Elbow curve in K-means using within cluster sum of squared to know the most suitable number of cluster to be used, also verify that with silhouette score.
   - Check for overfitting in all algorithms.
   - Add more comments in the codes to make it more clear.
      
## How to use the project
   - All the algorithms has a code block (the second or the third code block) headed with "loading datasets" where one can find pandas path command, change the path to      file you want the algorithm to work on.
